# Caroline-personal-website

Hi there! Welcome. I am currently learning the world of html and css. I am putting my new learnings to practice by building this website. This is a personal project and I hope to continuously improve its functionality and design. 

The website has been tested in Desktop: Microsoft Edge v95, Internet Explorer v10 and Chrome v94. It has been successfully tested and passed for stated browsers.
The wesbite has been tested in Mobile: IOS Chrome v94. Cosmestic Bug identified and is under investigation. 

**note: **Further functionality to be added once I gain more advanced skills and can incorporate JS. Simple design is for initial website, design improvements and content continue to be a work in progress.
