          <h3>👩🏻Product Manager</h3>
          <p>I work at HelloFresh in the Product team as a Product Manager! 
            This is a role where I really deep dive into data and customer feedback to find what our customers want next.
            I work across our web and app platform to optimise features, A/B test and strategically launch new products that are fit for our customers. 
            Join me on my journey in making delicious meals simple!

          <h3>🌼 Co-Founder of The Market Florals</h3>
          <p>Located in Paddy's Haymarket, this is a side hustle turned family business!
             I love teaching my customers on how to take care of their
            newly purchased plant babies and designing bouquets with beautiful
            seasonal flowers. I am constantly learning how to improve my arrangements,
          and colour schemes, so feedback is always appreciated. </p>

          <h3>🍪And more about me...</h3>
          <p>Cookies, Macarons, Egg Tarts, Pineapple buns... I love baking! I would
            love to say I am quite good at it, but it is definitely not true. My fair share of
          failures would have a lot to say about that. But, I love the idea of experimenting
        and finding new receipes, so if you are asking about whether you should bake this,
      ask me because I probably already have! And I like to make my own soy milk at home!</p>
